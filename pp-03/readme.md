## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13J0u0kpjb3h4jjlhfat+72Ew3u
Your Rationale: I am not a gaming person, but just by going through other websites, it seems that they use dark colors. It also depends on the mood/experience of the game. If it is a happy/joyful game then it might lean towards the brighter colors and other games like fighting are darker.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=55s0T0ktOMBihRho5OBKrIQIsrp
Your Rationale: Spring time and gardens creates bright and colorful feelings, so I picked these colors because they remind me most of the flowers we see in gardens that bring happiness.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=52Q150ksxulhKCOmMvKuToq-1jj
Your Rationale: I chose these colors because a majority of the letters of the alphabet are primary and secondary colors blue, red, green, and yellow.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=c3Z0y011N1kGlqO4qX3btsrZjeK%2B%2B00kGlqO4qX3btsrZjeK%2B%2B00kGlqO4qX3btsrZjeK%2B%2B00kGlqO4qX3btsrZjeK%2B%2B00
Your Rationale: I researched the different levels of cyber security dangers and it appeared to have blue, yellow, orange, and red as the 4 main ones.
