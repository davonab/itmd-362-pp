# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

2.https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. There is a clear call for action. Users know what to do next and why it benefits them.
   They understand the value proposition and purpose of the site
2. Site is responsive. Works with different screen sizes. There is no horizontal scrolling.
3. The relatable information is grouped together.
4. Content is scannable. There are short paragraphs, descriptive headings, lists and images.
5. Important commands are displayed as buttons, not links.
6. Let the user know their location within the website
7. Main logo on site will link to the homepage
8. Add hints to input fields, when questions are complicated instructions are helpful.
9. When the user misses an input, warn them with a cross and when it is correct alert them with a tick.
10. Make sure the fonts readable, avoid small and sophisticated fonts.
