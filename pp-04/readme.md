# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/controls/text-fields/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: On the MY.IIT website, they have a clear button that deletes all
input in both username and password inputs. However, it would be more beneficial if the user had the ability to only
delete input from a certain box instead of deleting everything. In my sketch, I put small x's in the right corner of each
input box so the user can delete only info that they messed up on.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/data-entry/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
